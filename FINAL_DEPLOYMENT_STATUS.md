### To Enable Organization Posting:

# Deploy Cloud Functions for content generation
firebase deploy --only functions

# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
```

### 2. Set Up Authentication
```bash
# Enable Authentication in Firebase Console
# Then create an admin user:
node scripts/create-admin-user.js
```

### 3. Get LinkedIn Organization ID
1. Go to your GDG LinkedIn company page
2. Click "Admin tools" → "View as member"
3. The URL will contain: `linkedin.com/company/{numeric-id}/`
4. Add to `.env`: `LINKEDIN_ORGANIZATION_ID={numeric-id}`

### 4. Optional: Bluesky Setup
1. Create app password at: https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords
2. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER=your-email@example.com
   BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   ```
