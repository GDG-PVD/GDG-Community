# GDG Community Companion

A sophisticated AI companion designed to preserve community knowledge and enhance engagement for Google Developer Groups.

## Inspiration

As community organizers, we face common challenges: creating consistent content, preserving institutional knowledge, and maintaining member engagementâ€”all while balancing limited volunteer time.

This project aims to combine Google's Agent Development Kit with structured information architecture to create an AI companion that not only automates routine tasks but actually preserves and evolves community knowledge over time.

## Three-Layer Information Architecture

The GDG Community Companion is built around a three-layer information architecture:

1. **Semantic Layer** - Structured knowledge base containing GDG event details, brand guidelines, and content templates
2. **Kinetic Layer** - Process workflows for content creation, scheduling, and cross-platform publishing
3. **Dynamic Layer** - Learning system that analyzes content performance and evolves strategies

## Core Features

- **Content Automation**: Converts event details into tailored content for multiple platforms
- **Knowledge Repository**: Creates a structured, searchable database of past events and content
- **Engagement Optimization**: Analyzes performance metrics to recommend optimal strategies
- **Transition Management**: Preserves organizational knowledge during leadership changes
- **Cross-Platform Publishing**: Manages content distribution across multiple social platforms

## Technical Architecture

Built using Google's ecosystem:
- Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- Vertex AI with Gemini models
- Pinecone Vector Database
- React frontend
