# ADR 1: Three-Layer Knowledge Architecture

## Context and Problem Statement

Community organizations like Google Developer Groups need a structured approach to preserving and evolving knowledge over time. This is especially critical during leadership transitions when tacit knowledge is at risk of being lost. We need a knowledge architecture that can capture not only static information but also processes and learned patterns.

## Decision Drivers

- Need to preserve tacit knowledge during leadership transitions
- Requirement for content consistency across platforms and over time
- Desire to learn from past engagement and improve strategies
- Need to balance immediate automation benefits with long-term knowledge preservation

## Considered Options

1. **Flat Document Repository**: Simple document storage with metadata and search
2. **Traditional Knowledge Base**: Wiki-style pages organized by categories
3. **Cognitive Architecture**: AI-centric approach focused solely on conversational access
4. **Three-Layer Information Model**: Separating static knowledge, processes, and learned patterns

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Three-Layer Information Model**, because it effectively separates different types of knowledge while enabling both immediate automation and long-term learning.

### Detailed Structure

1. **Semantic Layer** (Base Knowledge)
   - Static information about the community
   - Brand voice and style guidelines
   - Event templates and content formats
   - Core concepts and terminology

2. **Kinetic Layer** (Process Knowledge)
   - Workflows for content creation and approval
   - Cross-platform posting strategies
   - Event promotion sequences
   - Member engagement processes

3. **Dynamic Layer** (Evolutionary Knowledge)
   - Performance metrics on content effectiveness
   - Learned patterns from engagement data
   - Evolving strategies based on results
   - Historical context for decision-making

## Implementation Strategy

The three-layer model will be implemented using a combination of:

- **Vector Database** (Pinecone): For semantic search across all layers
- **Structured Storage** (PostgreSQL): For relational data and analytics
- **Agent-Based Access**: Specialized agents for interacting with different layers

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation of concerns between different types of knowledge
- Ability to evolve strategies based on real engagement data
- Preservation of tacit knowledge during leadership transitions
- Structured approach to knowledge management that scales across chapters

### Negative

- More complex than a simple document repository
- Requires careful design of vector embeddings and metadata
- Need for specialized agents to interact with different layers

## Follow-up Actions

- Design detailed schema for each knowledge layer
- Create embedding strategies for different types of content
- Implement initial knowledge ingestion workflows
- Develop specialized agents for the three layers
