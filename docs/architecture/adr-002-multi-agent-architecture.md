# ADR 2: Multi-Agent Architecture with ADK

## Context and Problem Statement

The GDG Community Companion needs to perform a variety of specialized tasks including content generation, scheduling, analytics, and knowledge management. We need to decide how to structure the agent system to balance specialization with coordination.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for specialized capabilities in different domains
- Requirement for coherent user experience despite multiple capabilities
- Leveraging Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) effectively
- Ensuring maintainability and extensibility of the system

## Considered Options

1. **Single Generalist Agent**: One agent handling all tasks with different prompts
2. **Independent Specialized Agents**: Multiple separate agents with no coordination
3. **Hierarchical Agent Architecture**: Orchestrator agent coordinating specialized sub-agents
4. **Peer-to-Peer Agent Network**: Agents communicating directly with each other

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Hierarchical Agent Architecture** using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), because it provides the benefits of specialization while maintaining a coordinated experience.

### Detailed Structure

1. **Core Agent Orchestrator**
   - Primary interface with users
   - Handles intent recognition and task routing
   - Maintains conversation context
   - Coordinates between specialized agents

2. **Specialized Sub-Agents**
   - **Content Generation Agent**: Creates optimized social media content
   - **Analytics & Learning Agent**: Analyzes performance and recommends improvements
   - **Planning & Calendar Agent**: Manages schedules and posting strategies
   - **Knowledge Management Agent**: Interfaces with the three-layer knowledge structure

## Implementation Strategy

This architecture will be implemented using Google's ADK:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent

# Create specialized agents
content_agent = Agent(
    name="content_specialist",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="Handles content creation tasks"
)

analytics_agent = Agent(
    name="analytics_specialist",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="Analyzes metrics and provides insights"
)

planning_agent = Agent(
    name="planning_specialist",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="Manages schedules and planning"
)

# Coordinator agent
community_agent = Agent(
    name="gdg_community_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="Coordinates responses to community questions",
    sub_agents=[content_agent, analytics_agent, planning_agent]
)
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation of responsibilities between agents
- Ability to optimize each agent for specific tasks
- Simplified development and testing of individual capabilities
- Coherent user experience despite specialized backend

### Negative

- More complex than a single generalist agent
- Requires careful design of agent coordination
- Potential for increased latency due to agent handoffs

## Follow-up Actions

- Define detailed capabilities for each specialized agent
- Create routing logic for the orchestrator agent
- Implement initial prompts and tools for each agent
- Set up testing framework for multi-agent interactions
