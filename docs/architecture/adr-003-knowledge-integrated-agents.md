# ADR 3: Knowledge-Integrated Agent System

## Context and Problem Statement

The GDG Community Companion's agent architecture needs to effectively leverage the three-layer knowledge system. We need to define how agents access, update, and learn from the knowledge layers while ensuring coherent functioning across specialized tasks.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for agents to access structured knowledge across all three layers
- Requirement for continuous learning and adaptation based on content performance
- Desire to maintain contextual awareness between agent interactions
- Need for efficient vector-based knowledge retrieval and storage

## Considered Options

1. **Agents with Direct Database Access**: Each agent directly interacts with the underlying databases
2. **Shared Services Pattern**: Centralized knowledge services accessed by all agents
3. **Knowledge Mediator Agent**: Dedicated agent that handles all knowledge operations for other agents
4. **Knowledge-Integrated Agent System**: Specialized agents with built-in knowledge capabilities and a shared vector store

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Knowledge-Integrated Agent System** with a shared vector store, because it provides both specialization and efficient knowledge sharing.

### Detailed Structure

1. **Core Components**
   - **Shared Vector Store**: Central Pinecone instance with namespaced collections for each layer and chapter
   - **Embedding Service**: Common service for generating consistent vector embeddings
   - **Intent Classification**: Natural language understanding for routing requests

2. **Agent Architecture**
   - **Core Orchestrator Agent**: Handles intent detection and request routing
   - **Content Agent**: Specialized for content generation with knowledge integration
   - **Knowledge Agent**: Manages the three-layer knowledge architecture

3. **Knowledge Access Patterns**
   - Each agent maintains references to the shared vector store instance
   - Agents use layer-specific namespaces (semantic, kinetic, dynamic)
   - Structured metadata enables filtered retrieval
   - Cross-layer queries allow comprehensive knowledge access

## Implementation Strategy

The knowledge-integrated agent system is implemented with:

- **Vector Store Interface**: Abstraction for Pinecone interactions using namespaces
- **Embedding Generation**: Vertex AI with Gemini models for consistent embeddings
- **Intent Classification**: LLM-based intent detection for intelligent routing
- **Content Performance Tracking**: Feedback loop from content performance to knowledge store

## Consequences

### Positive

- Agents can efficiently access and contribute to the knowledge structure
- Shared vector store reduces duplication and ensures consistency
- Performance feedback continuously improves content generation
- Clear separation of concerns while maintaining knowledge integration

### Negative

- More complex setup than simpler architectures
- Reliance on vector database performance and availability
- Need for careful namespace management across chapters
- More sophisticated prompt engineering for effective knowledge use

## Follow-up Actions

- Implement comprehensive testing for knowledge retrieval accuracy
- Create monitoring for vector store performance and usage
- Develop tools for knowledge visualization and manual curation
- Design additional specialized agents that leverage the knowledge system
