# ADR-001: Use Firebase as Primary Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed to choose a platform for hosting, authentication, database, and serverless functions for the GDG Community Companion. The platform needed to:
- Support real-time data synchronization
- Provide robust authentication mechanisms
- Scale automatically with usage
- Integrate well with Google's ecosystem
- Have reasonable pricing for community projects

## Decision
We will use Firebase as our primary platform, including:
- Firebase Hosting for the React frontend
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Firestore for the database
- Cloud Functions for serverless backend logic
- Firebase Storage for file uploads

## Consequences

### Positive
- Seamless integration with Google services
- Automatic scaling without infrastructure management
- Real-time data synchronization out of the box
- Built-in security rules for fine-grained access control
- Free tier sufficient for small communities
- Excellent documentation and community support

### Negative
- Vendor lock-in to Google's ecosystem
- Requires Blaze plan (pay-as-you-go) for Cloud Functions
- NoSQL database requires careful data modeling
- Some features like full-text search require external services

### Neutral
- Learning curve for Firebase-specific patterns
- Need to manage environment-specific configurations
- Requires Firebase CLI for deployment
