# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for implementing the GDG Community Companion.

## Repository Strategy

We use a dual-repository approach for security:

### Public Template Repository
- Contains all source code and documentation
- Uses `.env.example` files with placeholder values
- No actual API keys or secrets
- Safe to fork and share

### Private Implementation Repository
- Contains actual environment configurations
- Includes real API keys and credentials
- Private to your organization
- Used for production deployments

## Environment Configuration

### Never Commit Secrets
- Never commit `.env` files to public repositories
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude environment files
- Store secrets in secure environment variables
- Use placeholder values in examples

### Firebase API Keys
- Firebase API keys are designed to be public
- Security enforced through Firebase Security Rules
- Apply domain restrictions in Firebase Console
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Security Checklist

- [ ] All `.env` files listed in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Firebase Security Rules properly configured
- [ ] Domain restrictions applied to API keys
- [ ] Authentication required for sensitive operations
- [ ] Regular security audits performed
- [ ] Team members understand security practices

## Incident Response

If credentials are exposed:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Remove exposed credentials from repository
   - Regenerate affected keys/tokens
   - Deploy with new credentials

2. **Follow-up Actions**
   - Review how exposure occurred
   - Update security practices
   - Document lessons learned
   - Train team on prevention
